				<h3>Problem Discovery:</h3>
				<p>First, brief analysis. Post-its on page divided by criteria.</p>
				
				<div class="client_meeting">

					<span class="right75">
						<ul>
							<li>Analyze brief for key information.</li>
							<li>Ask questions about app features, design, brand, etc.</li>
							<li>Gain access to preexisting work (sketches, prototypes, etc.). What if i put more words here? does this stretch?</li>
							<li>Determine scope of problem.</li>

				<h3>User Research: </h3>
				<p>interviews (n=12) and survey (n=70).</p>
				<p>Survey data analysis goes here.</p>
				<p>Target demographic for interviews --> Interview notes for one of my intervies. I have notes from interview with Alain.</p>
				<p>Appended police officers to this list! watch out!</p>
				<p>Some way to visualize the interview data.</p>
				<p>Sum up all research findings into persona (mine was of black professionals and social activists). Recurring themes: People want to be heard.</p>
				<h3>Sketching and Ideation:</h3> 
				<p>Design Studio -- each feature sketched separately, and two iterations to apply others' ideas.</p>
				<p>Using features from each set of sketches, we came up with a master sketch including navigation.</p>
				<p>Rapid prototype using Marvel App. should I include a link to the first prototype here?</p>
				<p>Usability Testing. I only did one usability test-- what were the takeaways from that?</p>
				<p>Card Sorting to figure out content, organization, and layout of user rating page.</p>
				<p>More iterations on stuff with that, and update the master.</p>
				<p>Create mockups of updated master using Sketch and Illustrator. </p>
				<p>Branding theories: create a brand persona, and work to write out the app culture simply. Naming. Blind testing of potential users. "What do you think SWAT App does?" "What do you think Pulse does?"</p>
				<h3>Future Directions?</h3>
				<p>Story telling for client presentation.</p>
